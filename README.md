# hello-world
This is a short description for the newly created hello-world repository.

One of my immediate goals is to familiarize myself with GitHub.

I'm hoping to:
learn to use it
learn how I can use it
learn if i need it yet

it will take some effort to integrate.
But I like the idea of saving and editing my work.
